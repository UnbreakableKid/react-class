# NextJS

NextJS is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered applications. It is one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications and it keeps picking up steam. It is often mentioned as the best way to build a React application.

## Getting Started

I've already set up a NextJS application for you. To get started, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run:next
```
