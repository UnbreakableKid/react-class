# Base

React is a JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React itself, since it's a library, it doesn't come with a lot of features out of the box, like routing, state management, etc. This can be seen as a good thing, since you can choose the best tools for your project, but it can also be seen as a bad thing, since you have to choose the best tools for your project.

It also has no opinion on how you should structure your application, so you can choose the best structure for your project, and it usually differs from project to project.

The more recent pushes from the React team are to make React more like a framework, by teaming up with companies like Vercel to create frameworks like NextJS.
