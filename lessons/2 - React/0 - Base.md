# Base

React is a JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React itself, since it's a library, it doesn't come with a lot of features out of the box, like routing, state management, etc. This can be seen as a good thing, since you can choose the best tools for your project, but it can also be seen as a bad thing, since you have to choose the best tools for your project.

It also has no opinion on how you should structure your application, so you can choose the best structure for your project, and it usually differs from project to project.

The more recent pushes from the React team are to make React more like a framework, by teaming up with companies like Vercel to create frameworks like NextJS.

## Virtual DOM

React uses a **virtual DOM** to optimize the performance of the application. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When the state of the application changes, React will update the virtual DOM and compare it with the actual DOM. It will then only update the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This makes React very fast and efficient.
